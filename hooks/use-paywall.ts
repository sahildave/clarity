/**
 * Imperative access to the RevenueCat-hosted paywall and Customer Center.
 *
 * These present native views the dashboard owns, so plan mix, copy, pricing, and
 * layout change without an app release. Two ways in, and they are not
 * interchangeable:
 *
 * - `requirePro(action)` for gating. Presents only when the entitlement is
 *   missing, and runs the action once it is unlocked. This is the one to reach
 *   for at a locked feature.
 * - `presentPaywall()` for an explicit upgrade tap, where the customer asked to
 *   see the plans even if they already have them.
 *
 * The declarative alternative, `<RevenueCatUI.Paywall>` inside a route, lives in
 * `app/paywall.tsx`. Use that when the paywall should be a real navigation
 * destination; use these when it should sit on top of what the customer is doing.
